# SimuluxTesla Project Plan

## Project Overview
SimuluxTesla is a real-time corporate simulation and risk dashboard for Tesla, focusing on various risk domains.

## Goals
- Collect real-time data from multiple sources.
- Run multi-agent simulations to predict risks.
- Generate interactive reports and dashboards.

## Steps

### 1. Backend Development (FastAPI)
- **Setup FastAPI**:
  - Create a new FastAPI project.
  - Define routes for data collection and simulation.
  
- **Data Collection**:
  - Implement APIs for fetching data from Yahoo Finance, Reuters, etc.
  - Create web scraping utilities for additional data sources.

- **Simulation Engine**:
  - Develop a multi-agent simulation engine to process data and run simulations.
  - Implement risk scoring models.

### 2. Frontend Development (React + Tailwind CSS)
- **Setup React Project**:
  - Initialize a new React project with Tailwind CSS.
  
- **Dashboard Components**:
  - Create components for the dashboard (Simulation Card, Ripple Network, etc.).
  - Implement state management for real-time data updates.

- **Data Visualization**:
  - Use D3.js for interactive charts and graphs.
  - Display risk indexes and predictive chains.

### 3. Testing
- **Frontend Testing**:
  - Write tests using Jest and React Testing Library for all components.
  
- **Backend Testing**:
  - Implement unit tests for API endpoints and simulation logic.

### 4. Deployment
- **Backend**:
  - Deploy FastAPI on a cloud service (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
  
- **Frontend**:
  - Deploy React app on Vercel or Netlify.

## Conclusion
This plan outlines the necessary steps to develop the SimuluxTesla project, focusing on real-time data collection, simulation, and visualization.
